#Multiply2
This program will take in 2 integers n,m where (0 <= n,m < = 3), and print the product of the two.

#Reverse
<p>In the input field enter your input one-by-one as [List/Word length][List/Word], (e.g. 5Hello, or 6123456).  Where (0 <= list/word length <= 9).</p>
<p>It is best to compile this at https://sange.fi/esoteric/brainfuck/impl/interp/i.html and check the "Prompt for input" box.</p>
<p>This will take a list or word and reverse it.</p>
<p>A much easier implementation is "+[>,]<-[+.<-]", but this assumes the user enters all inputs at once.
<br>This program allows the user to enter the inputs one at a time.</p>
